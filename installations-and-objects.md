# Physical Installations and Objects

Digital tools offer many ways to shape experiences in the real world and work with physcial materials in extraordinary ways. This page is for anyone building things, installing objects in a physcial environment, or using digital fabrication techniques like 3D printing to create artworks or designs.

## Example projects

* Physcial art object(s)
* Installation or exhibition
* Detailed proposal for an exhibition 
* Speculative installation
* Design-based communtiy event or festival
* Curation of an art or design exhibition
* Public art or intervention 
* Fabricated designs or prototypes

**Note about design projects requiring fabrication equipment:** If you are interested in using PSU Main Campus fabrication equipment including laser cutters, 3D printers, CNC Routers, water-jet cutters, etc., you must coordinate a time to visit, complete requisite safety training in advance, and schedule a time on the required machines. Contact your professor for more information. Depending on your location, it is often less expensive to pay for an object to be fabricated using an online service or local company rather than paying for travel and lodging to come to Penn State Main Campus.

## Production requirements

1. **Research**
    * Evaluate previous events that were similar to this one
    * Identify stakeholders or exhibition locations
    * Research potential materials or fabrication techniques
        * 3D Printing
            * [Shapeways](https://www.shapeways.com/) — Mail order printing service
            * [Recommended comercial 3D printers](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-home-3d-printer/)
            * [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap) — Open source design for building a printer
        * Plotters and Cutters
            * [Recommended home cutters and plotters](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-electronic-cutting-machines-from-cricut-and-silhouette/) — These can cut paper and draw according to a digital design. 
            * [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com) — Mail order laser cutting and related fabrication
        * Electronics
            * [Adafruit projects, guides, and shop](https://learn.adafruit.com/)
            * [Arduino art projects](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/projects/tags/art)
            * [Physical computing examples](https://sunnie-sva-physicalcomputing.tumblr.com/)
       

2. **Project goals**
    * How will you measure the success of your project? 
    * What new skills or materials will you need to acquire?
    * Do you need the participation of outside parties? 

3. **Branding, website, other event infrastructure**
    * Consider how to advertise your project if you want to attract a public \(or online\) audience. 

4. **Identify a venue or location**

5. **Create a budget**

6. **Identify team members or volunteers if needed**

7. **Production of printed or fabricated materials, props and other objects**

8. **Create a call for participation, event registration, or other invitations for event attendance**

9. **Participate or observe hosted event or intervention**

10. **Event documentation and outcomes**
    * If you don't get a photo, did it really happen? 
    * Good video documentation is hard, you may need multiple camera and microphones to get enough footage. See the video page for suggestions. 
    * Phone cameras are pretty darn good these days, but it's still better to use a DSLR or Mirrorless camera if possible to get really stellar photos. Lighting may also be key.

## Proof of concept

**Exhibition or public project:** Create a detailed proposal including materials, budget, diagrams, and an outline of your production timeline. 

**Fabricated art or design object:** Create a prototype or detailed digital mockup.
