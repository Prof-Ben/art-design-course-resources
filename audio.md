# Audio Projects


## Types of Audio Projects
* Podcast 
* Audio tour or [site-specific](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/movement/site-specific-artenvironmental-art) experience
* Experimental installation \(something that explores the possibilities of sound and perception\)

If you are interested in creating an audio-focused project, it would be good to include some visual component such as branding designs, supplemental images/video, documentation, or a user interface for accessing and distributing the work. Talk to your instructor for more ideas.

## Production requirements

Depending on the type of project, you may need more or fewer steps than what are listed here.


1. **Asses Hardware Needs**

   ### Audio Recording Starter Kit

   * Microphone(s) — Here is a detailed [overview of common microphone types](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/types-of-microphones/).
      * Dynamic: Less sensative, hold close to speaker, good for interviews in loud spaces.
      * Condensor: More sensative, record far away sources \(including background noise... \)
   * Digital Audio Interface — Connect microphones to your computer; converts analog audio signals into digital ones. USB mics include a built-in version of this, but you'll get better quality with a truly analog mic and a seperate interface box. 
   * Portable recorder — All-in-one device with built-in mics! If you are on the tightest budget, you can manage an awful lot with one of these. [Zoom recorders](https://www.zoom-na.com) are industry standard and come at a variety of price points.
   * Headphones — Avoid anything with "bass-boosting technology" or earbuds. You want a nice even sound.
   * Speakers — Monitors or bookshelf speakers are the best bet; prioritize even sound reproduction over loudness or bass-boosting.

2. **Synopsis**

   * Write a short synopsis of the work.
   * Find examples of similar media to study and draw inspiration from.

3. **Script**

   For scripted narrative work, obviously write a script. Experimental or documentary work might not include this step.

   * [Scrivener](https://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener/overview)
   * [Final Draft](https://www.finaldraft.com/)
   * [Screenplay Formatter for Google Docs](https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/screenplay_formatter/351965757287)
   
   
4. **Sound recording**
   * [Sound foley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_tqB4IZvMk)
   * [Recording narration and actor dialogue](http://www.scarycow.com/lowbudgetaudio/)
   * [FreeSound](https://freesound.org/) — Library of Creative commons sound effects
   * [Free Music Archive](https://freemusicarchive.org/) — Library of creative commons music
   * [ZenCaster ](https://zencastr.com/)— Great tool for recording remote audio conversations between two people.

6. **Scoring or Original Production**

   * [GarageBand](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/premiere-pro-guru-audio-workflow-and-the-essential-sound-panel/) — Simple MIDI instruments and editing. 
   * [Premiere Pro](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/premiere-pro-guru-audio-workflow-and-the-essential-sound-panel/) — Edit audio right in your video editor or export entire projects to Audition...
   * [Adobe Audition](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/audition-cc-2019-essential-training/discover-adobe-audition-2019?u=76811570) \(LinkedIn Essential Training\) — Dedicated audio editor, record and mix, easily interface with Premiere \(no MIDI instruments\)
   * [Ableton Live](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/premiere-pro-guru-audio-workflow-and-the-essential-sound-panel/) \(LinkedIn Essential Training\) — Great MIDI and recording suite, relatively cheap, great for electronic music.
   * [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) — Record and mix, MIDI instruments \(especially ones that sound like traditional strings, brass, etc.\)
   * [Pro Tools](https://www.lynda.com/Pro-Tools-8-tutorials/film-scoring/52768-2.html?org=psu.edu) — Industry standard for recording and mixing; expensive.

7. **Mixing and Mastering**
   * Mixing — Balancing and dynamic adjustment for all channels.
      * [Mixing and Buses in Audition](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/audition-cc-2019-essential-training/understanding-the-mixer-panel?u=76811570)
      * [Adobe Audition: Mixing Music and Dialogue](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/adobe-audition-mixing-music-and-dialog/welcome?u=76811570)
   * Mastering — Refining the primary exported file.
      * [Audio Mastering Techniques](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/audio-mastering-techniques/welcome?u=76811570)
8. **Distribution**

   You'll want a high quality source copy of your project, but if you're uploading your project to the web, podcast services, or physcial playback devices, you will probably want a smaller file size.

   * [Guide to sample rates and bit depth](https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/digital-audio-basics-sample-rate-and-bit-depth.html)
   * Filetypes to Know:
      * WAV - Uncompressed, high quality, high filesize
      * MP3 - Lossy compression, low quality, loq filesize
      * FLAC - Lossless compressions, high quality, high filesize
