# Audio and Video Resources

## Types of video projects

* Narrative short film â€” Something with characters and a plot.
* Experimental film â€”  [Examples on vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/categories/experimental)
* Documentary short
* Animations â€” See Animation page ðŸ˜‰

## Types of Audio Projects
* Podcast 
* Audio tour or [site-specific](https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/movement/site-specific-artenvironmental-art) experience
* Experimental installation \(something that explores the possibilities of sound and perception\)

If you are interested in creating an audio-focused project, it would be good to include some visual component such as branding designs, supplemental images/video, or a user interface for accessing and distributing the work. Talk to your instructor for more ideas.

## Production requirements

Depending on the type of project, you may need more or fewer steps than what are listed here.




1. **Asses Hardware Needs**

   For some projects, you may need access to professional video and audio equipment, though a lofi aesthetic or concept realted to everyday devices might work well with phone cameras. A smartphone camera limits you to very [wide angle lens](https://www.nikonusa.com/en/learn-and-explore/a/tips-and-techniques/understanding-focal-length.html), but filmakers like Stephen Soderbergh have shot feature films with them! But if you're interested in these producing this kind of media professionally, it is probably worth investing in some hardware.

   Student discounts are offered at [B&H](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/find/eduAdvantage.jsp) and [Adorama](https://www.adorama.com/g/edu) and many manufacturers offer refurbished gear at slight discounts \(as does B&H\). You can also find kits that package the essential items together for a reduced price.

   ### Video Production Starker Kit

   * DSLR or Mirrorless Camera â€” offers greater [depth of field](https://digital-photography-school.com/understanding-depth-field-beginners/) and lens customization than a camcorder, and finer control of exposure, frame rate, and settings, than a smartphopne.

   * Tripod â€” Required for most professional video work.
      * [Smartphone tripod](https://www.amazon.com/Joby-GripTight-Smartphone-Action-Flexible/dp/B075M7MK35) â€” If shooting with a phone, you can still get a tripod!

   * Shotgun \(Hypercardiod\) Microphone â€” Best for directional recording if your subject is speaking; Rode makes good ones for DSLR cameras.

   * Lighting: a [reflector board](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1016048-REG/raya_cr_51_42_5_in_1_collapsible_reflector_disc.html) or piece of white foamcore can reflect light towards your subject, but electric lights on stands are best for stationary indoor photography.

   ### Audio Recording Starter Kit

   * Microphone(s) â€” Here is a detailed [overview of common microphone types](https://ehomerecordingstudio.com/types-of-microphones/).
      * Dynamic: Less sensative, hold close to speaker, good for interviews in loud spaces.
      * Condensor: More sensative, record far away sources \(including background noise... \)
   * Digital Audio Interface â€” Connect microphones to your computer; converts analog audio signals into digital ones. USB mics include a built-in version of this, but you'll get better quality with a truly analog mic and a seperate interface box. 
   * Portable recorder â€” All-in-one device with built-in mics! If you are on the tightest budget, you can manage an awful lot with one of these. [Zoom recorders](https://www.zoom-na.com) are industry standard and come at a variety of price points.
   * Headphones â€” Avoid anything with "bass-boosting technology" or earbuds. You want a nice even sound.
   * Speakers â€” Monitors or bookshelf speakers are the best bet; prioritize even sound reproduction over loudness or bass-boosting.

2. **Synopsis**

   * [Premiere Pro](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/premiere-pro-guru-audio-workflow-and-the-essential-sound-panel/) â€” Edit audio right in your video editor or export entire projects to Audition...
   * [Adobe Audition](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/audition-cc-2019-essential-training/discover-adobe-audition-2019?u=76811570) \(LinkedIn Essential Training\) â€” Dedicated audio editor, record and mix, easily interface with Premiere \(no MIDI instruments\)
   * [Ableton Live](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/premiere-pro-guru-audio-workflow-and-the-essential-sound-panel/) \(LinkedIn Essential Training\) â€” Great MIDI and recording suite, relatively cheap, great for electronic music.
   * [Logic Pro](https://www.apple.com/logic-pro/) â€” Record and mix, MIDI instruments \(especially ones that sound like traditional strings, brass, etc.\)
   * [Pro Tools](https://www.lynda.com/Pro-Tools-8-tutorials/film-scoring/52768-2.html?org=psu.edu) â€” Industry standard for recording and mixing; expensive.
