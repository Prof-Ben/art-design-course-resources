# Art & Design Course Resources

This guide is a curated list of resources and essential production tips for a variety of media types. Students in Penn State's DMD program will refer to this guide during upper level courses where they are expected to conduct their own research and manage production steps independently. 

Projects can leap between media and straddle disciplinary boundaries — but these resources had to be organized somehow! — so explore these pages as needed and don't feel constrained by these specific categories. 

## Media Categories

* [2D and 3D Animation](animation.md)
* [Apps and Interactive Media](apps-and-interactive.md) \(VR, AR, and games)
* [2D Design and Illustration](illustration-and-2d.md)
* [Web Design and Development](web-design.md) 
* [Video Production and Photography](video-and-photo)
* [Audio Production and Recording](audio.md)
* [Products, Services, and UX](products-services-ux)
* [Installations and Objects](installations-and-objects.md) \(digital fabrication, art objects, prototypes, and exhibitions\)

Each page describes potential project types, a recommended production timeline, and a proof of concept that you will produce early on to confirm your plan with your instructor. 

If you have a project idea that doesn't fall within one of these categories, just get in touch with your instructor!
